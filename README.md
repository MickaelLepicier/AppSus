# AppSus

# With this README we can wright TODO's to each other

### Mapping the project

- We build 2 Apps in this project (each of them in a diffrent page):
- MisterMail That is like Gmail
- MissKeep That is like google keep

- First I build the skeleton that hold all the apps together

# Work Plan

### Part 1:

- Put all the function you need in the utils + the LongText comp (30m)
- Put some data in the pages and check that everything is working (1h)

### Part 2:

- Create misterMail

- Deside the style of the app
- Create the Navbar on the left and put there the comps:
- MailIndex , MailList , MailPreview , MailDetails , MailFilter , MailFolderList , MailCompose

# Mickael TODO- Finish Part 1 and then keep building Part 2
